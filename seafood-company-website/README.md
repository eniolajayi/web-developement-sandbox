# Website project

I was **inspired** by a UI design I came across on Pinterest. The **balance**, proper use of **visual hierarchy** and the **minimal color palette** used was what grabbed my attention.
so I set out to try and replicate it. No design files provided whatsoever

**The design**

# Process

 **I defined a structure for the website**
There are so many ways I could go about this project honestly ( almost wasted time thinking about it üòÅ). I decided to define the structure first and by structure I mean bare bone HTML. I picked of each part of the design into sections namely:
 - A Header
 - Main content containing the first headline
 - A about section
 - A media section having the large image and video
 - A process section that defines how our fictitious company ''do it''
 - A products section
 - A contacts section and finally
 - The footer


## Tools

I decided to not introduce anything complex and went with just **HTML**,**CSS** and **JS**. I really wanted to dive in deep, learn a lot by using the basics and see how far I can go without needing some fancy library

## Style guide
This one was tricky but I think I nailed it
### font
- family : '**Poppins**'
- base size : **16px**

### colors
here made the colors **variables** in my css file to have proper theme and consistency
- --main-bg-color:  #222f40

- --lighter-bg-color:  #2f4159

- --faded-blueish-grey-color:  #707a8c

- --gold-color:  #bfa678;

- --cream-color:  #f2eeeb

- --grey-bg-color:  #f2f2f2

a work in progress
